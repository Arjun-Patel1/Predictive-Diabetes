# Predictive-Diabetes
Diabetes Prediction
This project focuses on building a highly accurate machine learning model to predict diabetes in individuals based on diagnostic health parameters. After thorough data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), two advanced models were trained and evaluated, achieving strong predictive performance.
